#Mosaic Tech Demo

This repo is a server that displays a conversational UI, tied into Nest's login page.

It was built using my Simple Static React boilerplate ( https://github.com/Jon-Biz/simple-static-react ), with an express server added on.

##Set up

- You'll need to have node installed.
- Clone the repo and install the node dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/Jon-Biz/mosaic-techdemo
cd mosaic-techdemo
npm i
```

##Usage

- Run the `server` script to start the server on port 80.

```
node server
```
